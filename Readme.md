# React Course

## First View Description

In this course, you will learn the fundamentals of React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. The first view you will create is a simple, interactive component that will help you understand the core concepts of React, including:

- **JSX**: A syntax extension for JavaScript that looks similar to HTML.
- **Components**: The building blocks of a React application.
- **Props**: Short for properties, these are used to pass data between components.
- **State**: A way to manage dynamic data within a component.
